This is a Perl program that can be used to print texts on labels and
envelopes. It generates PostScript output.

Features:

  - label and envelope formats can be defined in a configuration file
  - repeating text on labels
  - multi-pass printing of label sheets
  - prints KIX barcodes for dutch addresses

Installation: unpack the kit, and type the following commands in the
directory created by unpacking:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make all test

This program requires PostScript::Font version 1.03 or later.
It requires a Unix PostScript Resources file (.upr) to find the
necessary info for the fonts used. Adapt times.upr to your local
situation, and type:

    make all test

Now tailor blib/script/labels if needed:

  - Change the location of the site configuration file. This is
    pre-set to "/usr/local/lib/labels.cfg".

Now type "make install". Note that this command usually requires super
user privilege.

Inspect and edit the configuration file labels.cfg, and place it in
a location where the program can find it. The program looks for a
configuration file in one of the following places:

    .labels.cfg
    $HOME/.labels.cfg
    /usr/local/lib/labels.cfg

The first non-empty file found will be used.

Have fun!
